<b>centerOfMass</b>: this tool can get the center of mass of the features. It could use to convert area features into a point. For example, in a big scale map, it could better to show points instead of the boundaries. 
        <br><br>
        <b>buffer</b>: this is very useful tool to create an area around some features. It could be used to create a map with buffer around the fire station with a 10-min radius to see the cover area.
        <br><br>
        <b>intersect</b>: this tool will analyze two polygons to have an output with the overlap portion. This could use to create the most dangerous area when there are 2-year flood boundary and 5-year flood boundary. The overlay portion of these two boundaries will be the place to take caution. 
        <br><br>
        <b>PolygonToLineString</b>: this tool could convert polygon to linestring. This could be useful if only polygon data is found but the line data is needed, it could easily convert polygon to linestring. 
        <br><br>
        <b>nearest</b>: this tool can have a target point and compare the others points to find the nearest point to the target point. This could use to find the nearest gas station on the map.
